 In rails 3 Finding user agent is a easy way :)

By adding the one line in the controller page, we can get the UA.(@user_agent = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])

In /app/controllers/users_controller.rb

def index

  @users = User.all
  @user_agent = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
  

In /app/views/users/index.html.erb

<%= @user_agent %>

That's All :)
